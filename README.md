Social Cognitive Optimization (SCO)
===================================

SCO is a population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization problems as

where f(x) is the objective function and each g(x) is a constraint function to be satisfied, and _c_ and _d_ are constants. All the functions can be nonlinear and nonsmooth.
